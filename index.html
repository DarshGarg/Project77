    <h1>About Visual Studio</h1>
    <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft.
       <br>
       It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. 
       <br>
       Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. 
       <br>
       It can produce both native code and managed code.
       <br>
       Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. 
       <br>
       The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger.
       <br> 
       Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. 
       <br>
       It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).
       <br>
       Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists. 
       <br>
       Built-in languages include C, C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic .NET, C#, F#, JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Support for other languages such as Python, Ruby, Node.js, and M among others is available via plug-ins. 
       <br>
       Java (and J#) were supported in the past.
       <br>
       The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition, is available free of charge. 
       <br>
       The slogan for Visual Studio Community edition is "Free, fully-featured IDE for students, open-source and individual developers". 
       <br>
       As of March 2021 the current production-ready Visual Studio version was 2019, with older versions such as 2012 and 2013 on Extended Support, and 2015 and 2017 on Mainstream Support.

    <h1>About Console Screen</h1>
    <p>
        A console application is a program designed to be used via a text-only computer interface, such as a text terminal, the command line interface of some operating systems (Unix, DOS,[1] etc.) or the text-based interface included with most Graphical User Interface (GUI) operating systems, such as the Windows Console in Microsoft Windows, the Terminal in macOS, and xterm in Unix.
    </p>
    <h1>How to open console screen?</h1>
    <p>
        Consider the following use-case of creating and running a console application.
        <br>
        As minimum working example I will use the classical Hello World.
        <br>
        1. Create a new C# Console App (.NET Core or .NET Framework, doesn't matter).
        <br>
        2. In case .NET Framework was chosen, add Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); in the Main method. 
        <br>
        If .NET Core was chosen, it is already there.
        <br>
        Now run the application (e.g. in the default debug mode). 
        <br>
        A console window opens and closes immediately. 
        <br>
        You are not even able to read the Hello World. 
        <br>
        In e.g. Visual Studio Code (or other IDEs like e.g. Eclipse) console applications are running on a console integrated in the IDE. 
        <br>
        When the app has finished, the output is still visible.
